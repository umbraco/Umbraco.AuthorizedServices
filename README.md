## Aims

**Umbraco Authorized Services** is an Umbraco package designed to reduce the effort needed to integrate third party services that require authentication and authorization via an OAuth flow into Umbraco solutions.  It's based on the premise that working with these services requires a fair bit of plumbing code to handle creating an authorized connection.  This is necessary before the developer working with the service can get to actually using the provided API to implement the business requirements.

Having worked with a few OAuth integrations across different providers, as would be expected, there are quite a few similarities to the flow that needs to be implemented.  Steps include:

- Redirecting to an authentication endpoint.
- Handling the response including an authentication code and exchanging it for an access token.
- Securely storing the token.
- Including the token in API requests.
- Serializing requests and deserializing the API responses.
- Handling cases where the token has expired and obtaining a new one via a refresh token.

There are though also differences, across request and response structures and variations in the details of the flow itself.

The idea of the package is to try to implement a single, best practice implementation of working with OAuth that can be customized, via configuration or code, for particular providers.

## Features

For the solution developer, the Umbraco Authorized Services offers two primary features.

Firstly there's an tree available in the _Settings_ section of the backoffice, called _Authorized Services_. The tree shows the list of services based on the details provided in configuration.

Each tree entry has a management screen where an administrator can authenticate with an app that has been setup with the service.  The status of each service, in terms of whether the authentication and authorization flow has been completed and an access token stored, is shown on this screen.

Secondly, the developer has access to an interface - `IAuthorizedServiceCaller` - that they can inject instances of and use to make authorized requests to the service's API.

## Usage

### Installation

To easily install the package you can use the `Package Manager Console` from Visual Studio, or the `dotnet CLI` tool.

#### Package Manager Console
```
Install-Package Umbraco.AuthorizedServices
```

#### Dotnet CLI
```
dotnet add package Umbraco.AuthorizedServices
```


### App Creation

Services that this package are intended to support will offer an OAuth authentication and authorization flow against an "app" that the developer will need to create with the service.  From this various information will be available, including for example a "client ID" and "client secret" that will need to be applied in configuration.

### Configuring a Service

Details of services available need to be applied to the Umbraco web application's configuration, which, if using the `appSettings.json` file, will look as follows. Other sources such as environment variables can also be used, as per standard .NET configuration.

```json
  "Umbraco": {
    "CMS": {
        ...
    },
    "AuthorizedServices": {
      "TokenEncryptionKey": "",
      "Services": [
        {
          "Alias": "",
          "DisplayName": "",
          "ApiHost": "",
          "IdentityHost": "",
          "TokenHost": "",
          "RequestIdentityPath": "",
          "AuthorizationUrlRequiresRedirectUrl": true|false,
          "RequestTokenPath": "",
          "JsonSerializer": "",
          "RequestTokenFormat": "",
          "AuthorizationRequestRequiresAuthorizationHeaderWithBasicToken": true|false,
          "ClientId": "",
          "ClientSecret": "",
          "UseProofKeyForCodeExchange": true|false,
          "Scopes": "",
          "AccessTokenResponseKey": "access_token",
          "RefreshTokenResponseKey": "refresh_token",
          "ExpiresInResponseKey": "expires_in",
          "SampleRequest": ""
        },
      ]
    }
```

#### Configuration Elements

The following section describes each of the configuration elements. An example is provided for one service provider (GitHub).

Not all values are required for all services.  Those that are required are marked with an "*" below.

##### TokenEncryptionKey

Provides an optional key used to encrypt and decrypt tokens when they are saved and retrieved from storage respectively.

If not provided, the value stored in configuration at `Umbraco:CMS:Global:Id` will be used.

##### Services

The collection of services available for authorization and usage.

###### Alias *

The alias of the service, which must be unique across the service collection.

###### DisplayName *

Provides a friendly name for the service used for identification in the user interface.

###### ApiHost *

The host name for the service API that will be called to deliver business functionality.  E.g. for Github this is `https://api.github.com`.

###### IdentityHost *

The host name for the service's authentication endpoint, used to initiate the authorization of the service by asking the user to login. For GitHub, this is `https://github.com`.

###### TokenHost

Some providers make available a separately hosted service for handling requests for access tokens. If that's the case, it can be provided here. If not provided, the value of `IdentityHost` is used. For GitHub, this is not necessary as the value is `https://github.com`, the same as the identity host.

###### RequestIdentityPath *

Used, along with `IdentityHost` to construct a URL that the user is redirected to when initiating the authorization of the service via the backoffice. For GitHub, the required value is `/login/oauth/authorize`.

###### AuthorizationUrlRequiresRedirectUrl

Some providers require a redirect URL to be provided with the authentication request. For others, instead it's necessary to configure this as part of the registered app. The default value if not provided via configuration is `false`, which is sufficient for the GitHub example.

###### RequestTokenPath *

Used, along with `TokenHost` to construct a URL used for retrieving access tokens. For GitHub, the required value is `/login/oauth/access_token`.

###### RequestTokenFormat

An enum value that controls how the request to retrieve an access token is formatted. Options are `Querystring` and `FormUrlEncoded`. `Querystring` is the default value and is used for GitHub.

###### JsonSerializer

An enum value that defines the JSON serializer to use when creating requests and deserializing responses. Options are `Default` and `JsonNet` and `SystemTextJson`.

- `Default` - uses the Umbraco CMS default `IJsonSerializer`.
- `JsonNet` - uses the JSON.Net serializer.
- `SystemTextJson` - uses the System.Text.Json serializer.

###### AuthorizationRequestRequiresAuthorizationHeaderWithBasicToken

This flag indicates whether the basic token should be included in the request for access token. If true, a base64 encoding of <clientId>:<clientSecret> will be added to 
the authorization header.

###### ClientId *

This value will be retrieved from the registered service app.

###### ClientSecret *

This value will be retrieved from the registered service app.  As the name suggests, it should be kept secret and so is probably best not added directly to `appSettings.json` and checked into source control.

###### UseProofKeyForCodeExchange *
This flag will extend the OAuth flow with an additional security layer called [PKCE - Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-proof-key-for-code-exchange-pkce).
In the OAuth with PKCE flow, a random code will be generated on the client and stored under the name `code_verifier`, and then using the `SHA-256` algorithm it will be hashed under the name `code_challenge`.
When the authorization URL is generated, the `code_challenge` will be sent to the OAuth Server, which will store it. The next request for access token will pass the `code_verifier` as a header key, and the OAuth Server will
compare it with the previously sent `code_challenge`.

###### Scopes *

This value will be configured on the service app and retrieved from there. Best practice is to define only the set of permissions that the integration will need.  For GitHub, the single scope needed to retrieve details about a repository's contributors is `repo`.

###### AccessTokenResponseKey

The expected key for retrieving an access token from a response. If not provided the default `access_token` is assumed.

###### RefreshTokenResponseKey

The expected key for retrieving a refresh token from a response. If not provided the default `refresh_token` is assumed.

###### ExpiresInResponseKey

The expected key for retrieving the datetime of token expiry from a response. If not provided the default `expires_in` is assumed.

###### SampleRequest

An optional sample request can be provided, which can be used to check that an authorized service is functioning as expected from the backoffice.  For example, to retrieve the set of contributors to the Umbraco repository hosted at GitHub, this request can be used: `/repos/Umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/contributors`.

### Authorizing a Service

With one or more service configured, it will be available from the items within a tree in the _Settings_ section:

Clicking on an item will show some details about the configured service, and it's authentication status.

If the service is not yet authorized, click the _Authorize Service_ button to trigger the authentication and authorization flow. You will be directed to the service to login, and optionally choose an account.  You will then be asked to agree to the permissions requested by the app. Finally you will be redirect back to the Umbraco backoffice and should see confirmation that an access token has been retrieved and stored such that the service is now authorized. If provided, you can click the _Verify Sample Request_ button to ensure that service's API can be called.

### Calling an Service

To make a call to an authorized service, you first need to obtain an instance of `IAuthorizedServiceCaller`. This is registered with the dependency injection framework and as such can be injected into a controller, view or service class where it needs to be used.

If making a request where all information is provided via the path and querystring, such as GET requests, the following method should be invoked:

```csharp
Task<TResponse> SendRequestAsync<TResponse>(string serviceAlias, string path, HttpMethod httpMethod);
```

The parameters for the request are as follows:

- `serviceAlias` - the alias of the service being invoked (e.g. `github`).
- `path` - the path to the API method being invoked (e.g. `/repos/Umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/contributors`).
- `httpMethod` - the HTTP method to use for the request (e.g. `HttpMethod.Get`).

There is also a type parameter:
- `TResponse` - defines the strongly typed representation of the service method's response, that the raw response content will be deserialized into.

If you need to provide data in the request, as is usually the case for POST or PUT requests that required the creation or update of a resource, an overload is available:

```csharp
Task<TResponse> SendRequestAsync<TRequest, TResponse>(string serviceAlias, string path, HttpMethod httpMethod, TRequest? requestContent = null)
    where TRequest : class;
```

The additional parameter is:

- `requestContent` - the strongly typed request content, which will be serialized and provided in the request.

And additional type parameter:
- `TRequest` - defines the strongly typed representation of the request content.


If you need to work with the raw JSON response, there are equivalent methods for both of these that omit the deserialization step:

```csharp
Task<string> SendRequestRawAsync(string serviceAlias, string path, HttpMethod httpMethod);

Task<string> SendRequestRawAsync<TRequest>(string serviceAlias, string path, HttpMethod httpMethod, TRequest? requestContent = null)
    where TRequest : class;
```

Finally, there are convenience extension methods available for each of the common HTTP verbs, allowing you to simplify the requests and omit the `HttpMethod` parameter, e.g.

```csharp
Task<TResponse> GetRequestAsync<TResponse>(string serviceAlias, string path);
```

## Providers

The list of providers for which the package has been verified is maintained at the [Umbraco Documentation website](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-dxp/packages/authorized-services#verified-providers).

## Package Development

### Branching Strategy

The branching strategy in this repository follows a "gitflow" model:

- `main` contains the latest released version
- `develop` contains the work for the next minor release
- as needed `support/x.x.x` branches are introduced from tags used for updates to older versions

The following details are those useful for those contributing to development of the package, and for anyone interested in the how it has been implemented. For anyone using the package too, and finding the existing configuration options aren't sufficient to specify a particular service, there may be scope to provide a custom implementation for particular components.

### Component Description

Note that there has been a deliberate decision taken in designing the package to use a number of components, each responsible for a small part of the authentication and authorization flow. In this way, there's more scope for an implementor to replace specific parts of the implementation should they need to.

#### IAuthorizationClientFactory

Responsible for creating an HTTP client used for making authorization requests to the service's token endpoint. Implemented by `AuthorizationClientFactory`.

#### IAuthorizationParametersBuilder

Responsible for creating a dictionary of parameters provided in the request to retrieve an access token from an authorization code. Implemented by `AuthorizationParametersBuilder`.

#### IAuthorizationRequestSender

Responsible for sending the request to retrieve access tokens. Implemented by `AuthorizationRequestSender`, which depends on `IAuthorizationClientFactory`.

#### IAuthorizedServiceAuthorizer

Responsible for making requests to the authorized services for the purposes of authorization. Implemented by `AuthorizedServiceAuthorizer`.

#### IAuthorizationUrlBuilder

Responsible for building the URL used to instigate the authentication and authorization flow from the backoffice. Implemented by `AuthorizationUrlBuilder`.

#### IAuthorizedRequestBuilder

Responsible for creating a request to an authorized service, providing the content and access token. Implemented by `AuthorizedRequestBuilder`.

#### IAuthorizedServiceCaller

Responsible for making requests to the authorized services for the purposes of accessing business functionality. This is used by Umbraco solution developers and is described in detail above. Implemented by `AuthorizedServiceCaller`.

#### IRefreshTokenParametersBuilder

Responsible for creating a dictionary of parameters provided in the request to retrieve an access token from a refresh token. Implemented by `RefreshTokenParametersBuilder`.

#### ISecretEncryptor

Responsible for encrypting and decrypting stored tokens (or other values).

It has three implementations:

- `AesSecretEncryptor` - default implementation that is using a standard `AES` cryptographic algorithm for encrypting/decrypting values based on the provided `TokenEncryptionKey`.
- `NoopSecretEncryptor` - provides no encryption saving the provided token as is.
- `DataProtectionSecretEncryptor` - additional implementation that uses the `IDataProtectionProvider` interface for providing data protection services.

Switching the encryption engine to for example `DataProtectionSecretEncryptor` can be done in code, adding these two lines:

```
builder.Services.AddUnique<ISecretEncryptor, DataProtectionSecretEncrytor>();
```

#### ITokenFactory

Responsible for instantiating a new strongly typed `Token` instance from the service response. Implemented by `TokenFactory`.

#### ITokenStorage

Responsible for storing tokens. Implemented by `InMemoryTokenStorage` and `DatabaseTokenStorage`.

#### IAuthorizedServiceCache

Responsible for caching data payload. Implemented by `AuthorizedServiceAuthorizationPayloadCache` to store the authorization payload.

#### IAuthorizedServiceAuthorizationPayloadBuilder

Responsible for generating the authorization payload used between the authorization and access token requests. Implemented by `AuthorizedServiceAuthorizationPayloadBuilder`.
